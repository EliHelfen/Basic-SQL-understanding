# Basic-SQL-understanding
This repo has a few examples of my code on a database. It includes its creation, filling, and a few queries. It was part of a larger project that I took part in that used web design that I did not develop by myself.
## Queries 
### Query 1 
This Query uses a simple aggregate function to create a rating based on the likes and dislikes of a beer on the database.
### Query 2 
This Query uses aggregate functions and a subquery to calculate the price of someones tab based on the price and quantity of the beers in the tab.
### Query 3 
This Query calculates the rating of a brewery based on the rating of the beers that they brew. 
### Query 4 
This Query lists all the beers served at a bar with a specific name.
### Query 5 
This Query calculates the rating of a bar based on the rating of the beers that they serve.
### Query 6 
This Query was meant for the front page to list the top five beers based on rating and had a shifting function to see the next five beers following.
### Query 7 
These are a few insert and delete commands that would be used on the webpage to add or delete from the database.
