# Basic-SQL-understanding
This repo has a few examples of my code on a database. It includes its creation, filling, and a few queries. It was part of a larger project that I took part in that used web design that I did not develop by myself.
## Queries 
### Query 1 

### Query 2 

### Query 3 

### Query 4 

### Query 5 

### Query 6 

### Query 7 
These are a few insert and delete commands that would be used on the webpage to add or delete from the database.
